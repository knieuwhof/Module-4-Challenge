A Whale off the Port(folio)

For the custom portfolio section, please see the Google Finance function/code used below. I copied and pasted the data from this function into another Google Sheet in order to update the "Close" column to the ticker. I later realized this code was needed to be demonstrated as per the marking comments in Bootcamp Spot. 
= GOOGLEFINANCE("GOOGL","close","2015-01-01","2019-12-31")
= GOOGLEFINANCE("AAPL","close","2015-01-01","2019-12-31")
= GOOGLEFINANCE("META","close","2015-01-01","2019-12-31")
